## Starter Workflows & Organizational Sharing

### **Starter Workflows**

- **What:** Starter workflows allow everyone in your organization who has permission to create workflows to do so more quickly and easily

- **Why?**
    - time saver
    - promotes consistency
    - serves as exemplar for following best practices

### Task

Let's dive ü§ø in and create an organization, a starter workflow, and then run it! üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

- Go github.com and create a new organization from the `+` dropdown menu
  
![Screenshot workflow](img/create-organization.png)
- Select the free tier option ("create a free organization")
- Set the organization name to anything you wish (must be unique across Github), and use your first.last@eficode.com email for the contact.
- Set `this organization belongs to` "My personal account"
- Attempt to prove you're not a robot ü§ñüñºÔ∏è (good luck)
- Accept the TOS (after reading of course üìñ), and click next
- On the Welcome page click `skip this step` on the bottom
- Spam click the submit option on the bottom of the page to bypass the survey information
- click the `Repository` tab

## Using the Starter Workflow

- Go to the Actions tab on the .github (or any repo owned by the org) and you should see a section "By Organization name"

click configure
click start commit
commit to main branch (create new file)
go back to Actions and click on build and then you should see the steps

## Organizational Sharing

- Assets that can be shared organization wide: 
  - starter workflows (as above)
  - secrets & variables
    - Navigate to main organization page and click on settings
